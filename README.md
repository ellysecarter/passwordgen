## Description
This website is a password generator to create unique passwords. 

After a client clicks the "Generate Password" button, they first choose between 8 and 128 characters, they can then select to use uppercase, lowercase, numeric, or special characters. After that, the system creates their unique password and displays it on the screen for them.

## Technique
I originally wanted every piece of criteria to have their own if/else statement. After further thought, I combined all the criteria only after they chose the amount of characters they wanted and made one else statement at the end of the generatePassword function. It looks a lot more cleaner this way and makes a lot more sense.
